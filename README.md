Airline Reservation System

Overview

This project is a simple Airline Reservation System implemented using structured programming in C++. It allows users to book, view, and manage airline reservations through a console-based interface.

Features

Flight Booking: Users can reserve a seat on a specific flight.

View Reservations: Display a list of current reservations.

Cancel Reservation: Remove a booking from the system.

Search Flights: Search for available flights based on criteria like destination or date.

Purpose

This project demonstrates:

The use of structured programming concepts such as functions and arrays in C++.

A practical application of basic programming principles to solve real-world problems.

System Design

The program follows a structured programming approach, avoiding object-oriented concepts. It is modularized into the following functions:

main(): The entry point of the program.

displayMenu(): Shows the main menu options to the user.

bookFlight(): Handles flight reservations.

viewReservations(): Displays all current bookings.

cancelReservation(): Allows users to cancel a booking.

searchFlights(): Searches for flights based on user input.
