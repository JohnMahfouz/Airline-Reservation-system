# ✈️ Airline Reservation System

## 📌 Overview

This is a **console-based Airline Reservation System** implemented using **structured programming in C++**. The system allows users to **book, view, search, and cancel flight reservations** in a simple and intuitive way.

## 🚀 Features

- **✈️ Flight Booking:** Reserve a seat on a specific flight.
- **🧾 View Reservations:** Display all current bookings.
- **❌ Cancel Reservation:** Remove a booking from the system.
- **🔍 Search Flights:** Find flights based on destination or date.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates:

- The application of **structured programming concepts** in C++ (functions, arrays, control structures).
- A simple real-world system built without object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Modular and maintainable code suitable for beginners learning procedural C++.

## 🧩 System Design

The program is modularized using functions for clarity and reusability:

- `main()` – Entry point of the system.
- `displayMenu()` – Shows available options to the user.
- `bookFlight()` – Handles flight reservation logic.
- `viewReservations()` – Lists all current reservations.
- `cancelReservation()` – Allows users to cancel an existing booking.
- `searchFlights()` – Searches available flights based on user criteria.
